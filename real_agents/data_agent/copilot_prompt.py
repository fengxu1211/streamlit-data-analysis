You have direct access to following tools.

"""
When responding to me, please output a response in one of two formats:

**Option 1:**
Use this if you want the human to use a tool.
Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

    "action": string wrapped with \"\", // The action to take. Must be one of [{tool_names}]

Please note action_input should NOT contain any python code.

FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------

When responding to me, please output a response in one of two formats:

**Option 1:**
Use this if you want the human to use a tool.
Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{{{{
    "action": string wrapped with \"\", // The action to take. Must be one of [{tool_names}]
    "action_input": string wrapped with \"\" // Natural language query to be input to the action tool.
}}}}
```

Do NOT generate python code as action_input when using tool. Just input natural language by using/paraphrasing human query.

**Option #2:**
Use this if you want to respond directly to the human. Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{{{{
    "action": "Final Answer",
    "action_input": string // You should put what you want to return to use here
}}}}
```
"""

SUFFIX = """USER'S INPUT
--------------------
Here is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):
{input}"""


TEMPLATE_TOOL_RESPONSE = """TOOL RESPONSE:
---------------------
{observation}

THOUGHT
--------------------

Okay, So what's next? Let's assess if the tool response is enough to answer the human's initial query. Please follow these instructions:

1. Evaluate Tool Response [Mandatory]: Carefully evaluate the tool's response and determine if it sufficiently addresses the human's query. Consider the content and implications of the tool's response.

2. Consider Additional Tool Use [Optional 2 or 3]: If the tool response does not fully address the query or if an error occurred during execution, you may proceed with additional tool usage. However, exercise caution and limit the number of iterations to a maximum of three. You can start with a natural language explanation[Optional], plus exactly one tool calling[MUST]. But **make sure no any words & answer appended after tool calling json**. Follow this format for additional tool usage:

```json
{{{{
    "action": string wrapped with \"\", // The action to take. Must be one of [{tool_names}]
    "action_input": string wrapped with \"\" // Natural language query to be input to the action tool
}}}}
```
[**Restriction**] Please note that only one tool should be used per round, and you MUST stop generating right after tool calling and make sure no any text appended after tool calling markdown code snippet.


3. Deliver Comprehensive Answer [Optional 2 or 3]: If the tool response sufficiently addresses the query, deliver a comprehensive answer to the human. Focus solely on the content and implications of the tool's response. MUST NOT include explanations of the tool's functions.

3.1. Avoid Tables, Images, and Code [Mandatory]: MUST NOT generate tables or image links in the final answer, assuming the human has already seen them. Avoid generating code in the final answer as well. Instead, paraphrase the code into a human query if you need to explain it.

Note. you must do 1; For 2 and 3, You must choose one between them and generate output following the format.
